## Controls
* **Arrow Keys:** Movement
* **Space:** Jump
* **Left Ctrl:** Consume Orb

## Objective
Hold on to the orb to accumulate starlight in the orb. Consume the orb (left ctrl) to cash in the accumulated starlight.
All accumulated starlight will be added to your score.

But be careful! Other sea creatures are out to steal your orb!
If your orb is stolen before you manage to consume it, all the accumulated starlight in the orb will be lost.

## Events
Pay attention to the event predictions on the right side of the screen to plan out your course of action to maximise your score.
Events may be good or bad.

Even though an event is predicted to occur, it may not actually occur. This is determined by the probability displayed below each event's icon.
With a limited field of vision however, only the events can tell you what is happening.
